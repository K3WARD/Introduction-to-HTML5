    <summary>Why I'm taking the Introduction to HZTML 5 Course</summary>
    For the last 20 years I've been working as an Accountant and while I've enjoyed my job I have wanted to change careers and try something else.
    I've always been interested in Web development and decided to give it ago. As well as the Web Design 4 everyone Specialisation I'm also enrolled in the Building Web Applications in PHP specialisatin, also offered by Michigin University.
